Steps can trigger one of the following options:

-  ``Mail``: Sends an email using a template.
-  ``Server Action``: Executes a server action.
-  ``Activity``: Creates an activity to the related record.

All the steps need to specify the moment of execution. We will set the
number of hours/days and a trigger type:

-  ``Start of workflow``: It will be executed at the
   previously-configured time after we create the record.
-  ``Execution of another step``: It will be executed at the
   previously-configured time after the previous step is finished
   properly.
-  ``Mail opened``: It will be executed at the previously-configured
   time after the mail from the previous step is opened.
-  ``Mail not opened``: It will be executed at the previously-configured
   time after the mail from the previous step is sent if it is not
   opened before this time.
-  ``Mail replied``: It will be executed at the previously-configured
   time after the mail from the previous step is replied.
-  ``Mail not replied``: It will be executed at the
   previously-configured time after the mail from the previous step is
   opened if it has not been replied.
-  ``Mail clicked``: It will be executed at the previously-configured
   time after the links of the mail from the previous step are clicked.
-  ``Mail not clicked``: It will be executed at the
   previously-configured time after the mail from the previous step is
   opened and no links are clicked.
-  ``Mail bounced``: It will be executed at the previously-configured
   time after the mail from the previous step is bounced back for any
   reason.

   previously-configured time after the activity from the previous
   action is done.

   previously-configured time after the previous action is executed if
   the related activity is not done.
